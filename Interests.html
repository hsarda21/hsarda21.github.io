						<li>Counter Strike : Global Offensive</li>
						<li>Just Cause 3</li>
						<li>Sleeping Dogs : Definitive Edition</li>

				<td class = "info"> Writing. I like to write a lot of things, some of them are:
					<ul>
						<li>My short liners are available on instagram on my page - The White Ink. </li>
						<li>I like to write short stories too, which are available on my blog - The Crazy Writer. </li>
					</ul>
					I'm currently working on writing motivational stuff, it feels good to write something motivational. I do it not with the motive to help people or anything but its just because writing such things makes me happy. And if it helps people, that's just a bonus.

				<td style = "vertical-align: top;"><div class=reading></div></td>
				<td class = "info"> Reading. I've actually liked reading since the beginning, although when I was younger I considered reading novels to be a waste of time. But now I feel that every book has something to teach us and I'm eager to finish every book I like and that'll help me with something. Some books I've read are :
					<ul>
						<li>Eleven Minutes - By Paulo Coelho</li>
						<li>Body Language - By Allan Pease</li>
						<li>13 Reasons Why - By Jay Asher</li>
						<li>Revolution 2020 - Chetan Bhagat</li>
					</ul>
				Every book was different. Some were recommended to me by a friend or relative, while some were my own choice to try out. I plan on having my own collection of books, but I have not given much thought to this plan. For now, I read as much as I enjoy.
