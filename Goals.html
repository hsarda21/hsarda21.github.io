				<b>Live with my Family</b> : As I get a job, I will have to go to another city or another country. My brother already works away for his job. I don't want everyone in my family to spread out. My goal is to get a job in the same place as my brother, so all our family can live together. <br/><br/>

				<b>Perfect Advices</b> : I want to help people. Whenever anyone needs a advice the first name that comes to their mind should be "Harshit" but that takes a lot of practice. Plus, you cannot give wrong advices to people who trust you. <br/><br/>
